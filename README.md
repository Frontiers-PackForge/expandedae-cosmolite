Expanded AE currently only adds a few new features.  
This mod is community-driven, so suggest any ideas you might have and they might get added.

~~Port to 1.21.1 coming very soon..~~ <br />
**No.**

## What's included currently:

- Expanded Pattern Provider which has 72 slots for patterns so you don't have to build workarounds if you require more pattern slots for one machine, also added is the cable part version.

- Upgrade item, so you can upgrade existing pattern providers while keeping their patterns in them.

## Roadmap
- [x] Add an auto complete card to the pattern provider
  - Added in Beta 1.0.2
- [ ] Pattern Refiller Card 
  - Upgrade for Pattern Terminals, automatically restocks the terminal with blank patterns
- [ ] Sticky Card
  - Lets an item/fluid enter the network only on that storage bus.
Basically, if you had Storage Bus A and B, and one had a sticky card with the filter to cobblestone. Storage Bus A would be the only option even if Storage Bus B had a higher priority/open space etc. If an item can't be pushed/sent to where a sticky card is located for it, the item will never move through the network
- [ ] Advanced Blocking Card
  - Exposes the entire networks contents when placed in an interface, allowing blocking mode to be used on an entire subnet.
  
  - Basically, when you place the card inside of an interface/extended interface/etc, It exposes the entire contents of the connected network to itself, which makes it work with blocking mode
  
  - HOWEVER due to how Modern AE2 treats blocking mode in modern vs 1.7.10, what the card should realistically do on modern is disable insertion to the interface it's in, if the network contains items, as then it's effectively blocking mode 'regardless' of what pattern   provider pushes to that subnet, which would be extremely potent for larger automation setups
- [ ] ME Filter Configuration terminal
  - A terminal that allows you to view all filters that connected devices contain for ease of locating

- [ ] Locate pattern providers from the crafting status menu by shift clicking the item.
  - Can be useful when you quickly want to diagnose where a craft is stuck.

- [ ] Pattern optimization matrix
  - Basically gives you the ability to multiply all patterns from the crafting menu, really basic explanation but check gtnh ae2 if this interests you. Still debating if there's any actual usecase for this.
     
- [ ] Pattern encoding optimization
  - Shift clicking when encoding will add the pattern to your inventory
  - Ability to multiple/divide processing patterns directly in the terminal (credits: [Ghostipedia](https://github.com/Ghostipedia) <3))
