## Do you also like having extra threads to process crafting requests faster? Dumb question, everyone does! 
### The mod adds [Crafting Co-Processing units](ae2:items-blocks-machines/crafting_cpu_multiblock.md) ranging from 2x to 1M extra threads per block.
### Also added is a base Crafting Unit to match the style!
