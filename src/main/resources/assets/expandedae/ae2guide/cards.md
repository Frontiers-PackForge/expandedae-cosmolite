## Currently, the mod only adds the two upgrade cards listed below
- Auto Complete Card: This card is an upgrade for Pattern Providers, it automatically cancels the craft once
it has pushed the pattern. _Note: Will break with crafting patterns, so be careful_

- Pattern Refiller Card: This card is an upgrade for the <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:wireless_universal_terminal" />
that will automatically refill the blank pattern slot in the Expanded Encoding Terminal
